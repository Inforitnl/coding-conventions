# INFORIT's code conventions

In this repo you'll find some base code convention files as well as some .ignore files to use in projects.

## prettier

prettier has its own package: [inforit-prettier-config](https://github.com/Inforitnl/prettier-config)

## two editorconfigs?

Yes. For c# projects we use [.editorconfig.project](./.editorconfig.project) and for all other projects (including smaller c# stuff) we use [.editorconfig](.editorconfig)
